This mod helps get better positioning. You can change the amount that snapping goes to. You can do this with degrees and units. Go to Edit > Preferences > Mods > Unit Movement to edit these values.<br /><br />

This is the beginning of a large amount of mods going to be made for Protobot that I will be making with my team for QOL features<br />
